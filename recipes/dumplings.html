        <p>One of the perks of living in Beijing was having the various 
            options of delicious frozen dumplings from grocery stores. 
            Dumplings were a must-have in my fridge when I was living there. 
            Whenever I felt too lazy to cook, I simply boiled a dozen dumplings and 
            then had dinner ready in 10 minutes. Unlike the frozen dumplings (or potstickers) 
            you can find in the US, Chinese frozen dumplings use a nicer dough that 
            resembles homemade dumplings with a juicy filling. The filling is usually 
            quite large, almost like a small meatball.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite frozen dumpling brands is Wanchai Ferry (湾仔码头),
            a local brand owned by General Mills that sells dozens of flavors 
             that are only available in China. Those frozen dumplings were so good that 
             sometimes I needed to suppress the urge of writing to General Mill and 
             demanding them to sell this line of product in the US!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound (230 grams) ground beef (at least 20% fat)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken stock (or beef stock, or water)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce (or soy sauce)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ginger , grated</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground toasted Sichuan peppercorn (or black pepper)</li>
            <li>4 green onions , coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 large carrot , coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen corn , thawed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen green peas , thawed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>20 homemade dumpling wrappers (or packaged dumpling wrappers)            </li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dumpling filling, add ground beef into a big bowl. 
                Add chicken stock, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, ginger, salt, 
                and toasted Sichuan peppercorns. Mix by using a pair of chopsticks 
                until the liquid is fully absorbed. Cover with plastic wrap, and 
                let marinate in the fridge while you prepare other ingredients.</li>
            <li>(Optional) You can start making dumpling dough now if you’re planning
                 to use homemade dumpling wrappers.</li>
            <li>Add carrot into the food processor. Mix until finely chopped. Add 
                green onions. Mix until the onions are finely cut. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>When you’re ready to make the dumplings, add minced green onion, 
                carrot, corn, green peas and sesame oil into the ground beef 
                mixture. Stir to mix well.</li>
            <li>Scoop about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons dumpling filling and place it in 
                the center of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and 
                start sealing the edges with the other hand. After folding, press 
                the edges again to seal well. You can use any way to fold the 
                dumplings as long as you’re comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>Now you can freeze these dumplings if you don’t cook them immediately. 
                Place them onto a baking tray and seal with a plastic wrapper. 
                You can store the dumplings in the freezer for up to 1 month. 
                Once the dumplings are completely frozen, after about a day, 
                you can transport them to a gallon bag to save freezer space.</li>
            <li>Cook the dumplings in batches. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick 
                skillet over medium heat until hot. Add dumplings. Cook until the 
                bottom side turns golden. Add 2 tablespoons water, and cover. 
                Cook until the other side also turns golden and the dumplings 
                are cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>You can serve the dumplings immediately with dumpling dipping 
                sauce (the spicy dumpling sauce works extremely well with these 
                beef dumplings).</li>
        </ol>
